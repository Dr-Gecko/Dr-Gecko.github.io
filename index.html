    <h1>ORVA Capture The Flag</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to the Oregon Virtual Academy Capture The Flag Challenge!</h2>
    <h2>There are only a few rules!
        1. Do not cheat by looking at the master repo for this site. \n
        2. If you find a flag DM it to me in discord. \n
        3. Hints may be provided, ask me in discord for a hint if you need one. \n
        The flags will look something like 0RVA{flag}
