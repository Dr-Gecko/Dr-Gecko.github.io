    <h1>ORVA Capture The Flag</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to the Oregon Virtual Academy Capture The Flag Challenge!</h2>
    <p>There are only a few rules!
    <p>    1. Do not cheat by looking at the master repo for this site. </p>
    <p>    2. If you find a flag DM it to me in discord. </p>
    <p>    3. Hints may be provided, ask me in discord for a hint if you need one. </p>
    <p>    The flags will look something like 0RVA{flag}, there are currently three flags to find.
