Many applications close sometime in Spring, and it’s a good idea to think ahead about what you want to do. Thankfully, many opportunities exist out there, such as volunteering, summer jobs, camps, and so on. Here are some of my top picks:<br/></p><ol><li><p>Volunteering- There are thousands of organizations that need ambitious volunteers. You can choose to find volunteer opportunities locally with volunteermatch.org, or you can check out online organizations such as Interns4Good. I recommend you filter based on preference!</p></li><li><p>Jobs- This depends heavily on your age. 13-15 years old will have less options than 16-17 or over 18 year olds. Do a Google search for jobs around your area that employ people your age or find local opportunities. </p></li></ol><p>Did you know StrideK12 offers student jobs? You can check it out by making a Tallo account or visiting the site.</p><p><a data-id="l-0819857656" href="https://www.k12.com/stride-career-prep/about/student-advisory-council/application/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.k12.com/stride-career-prep/about/student-advisory-council/application/</a></p><p>3. Camps- Examples of some camps I’ve attended are ones from Saturday Academy and THPRD in subjects such as manga drawing, STEM/ robotics, and writing. Find out which ones are close to your area. K12 also offers some virtual camps (which are announced) so keep an eye out for that too! <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Written by Ambika Vyas</p>                </div>            </div>        </div>    </div>    <div class="clear"></div></div></div><div class="widget widget-image var-image-standard" id="w-4365456531">      <div class="pagegrid">      <div class="six columns alpha omega">        <div class="wrapper">          <div class="framed-image-container no-drag " data-clicktarget="#">                                                                            <img class="framed-image" src="https://s.smore.com/u/thumbs/537f/thumb-780730ff6ba99f1b9c4f7682b200f138.png" alt="Big picture" title="Big picture" />                                                                                        </div>                  </div>      </div>      <div class="clear"></div>    </div>    </div><div class="widget widget-text-paragraph var-paragraph-standard" id="w-1798932107"><div class="pagegrid">    <div class="row">        <div class="six columns alpha omega">            <div class="content">                                <h2 class="theme-p-title theme-color3" data-target="title" data-clicktarget="#">                Creator&#39;s Corner                </h2>                                <div class="theme-p theme-color-4" data-target="content">                    <p><strong>Emily and Sophia </strong></p><p><br/></p><p>By Mike Mack </p><p> </p><p><br/></p><p>It was a nice, peaceful morning for the most part, the birds were singing, flowers were blooming, and children were playing, except for one. A 12-year-old girl named Sophie, who had just gotten abruptly woken up by the noise of the other children. She Tried to tune it out and get some more shut eye until one of the rude children rock her bed saying “Come on! Come on! Wake up Sophie, you’ve slept long enough!” she growled at him and yelled “Go away Ethan!”, Ethan did a mocking gesture and ran off laughing along with the other children. She continued to try and get some sleep, but she was no longer sleepy after yelling at Ethan, but she still did not want to get up. She laid there thinking about what it would have been like having a real family again as she had done a thousand times already. She looked outside of the window, at the morning sun shining down onto the dew on the grass, the flowers and the trees. “It’s so beautiful, it looks like it’s rained magic everywhere.” She whispered to herself. A few minutes later of staring outside of the window and admiring her surroundings, she heard an old lady call to everyone “Breakfast! Breakfast! Come on now children it’s time for breakfast!” while ringing a bell they called the breakfast bell. Sophie was hungry so she ran down the stairs swiftly while being careful not to trip. Breakfast was the same as always, porridge that came with a side of fresh fruits. As Sophie was getting her bowl she had asked the lady serving food, “Why is it always porridge for breakfast? Why can’t we have cereal or eggs and toast?” she said in a curious manner, the lady serving food responded with “Porridge is a cereal dear, just warmer!” and she sent Sophie off so she could serve next in line. Sophie went to go sit down so she could eat her porridge and fruit. She didn’t have much or make much friends despite how long she’s been there, so she didn’t quite feel comfortable sitting down anywhere with a lot of other children but there was usually always a table that she sat at in the back that was empty most of the time. So she went and sat down at the table and did the only thing she could do when she ate by herself, stirred her porridge and went back to thinking about what’s outside. </p><p>Meanwhile a little bit of ways away there was another girl, named Emily, who had lost her brother recently and her family has gone through a lot since then. Emily was currently in the car with her parents. And no matter how many times she groaned at them, asking them to tell her where they were going, “We’re going to go meet someone” is what they said with a smile on their face. Emily didn’t know who they were going to meet, and she didn’t care, she just wanted to go back home and do things she enjoyed; reading, playing games with her friends and listening to some rock music, which was one of her favorite genres. She got bored of asking her parents the same question over and over and eventually decided to just remember the beats of her favorite song in her head while looking out of the window, she was so busy thinking of music and her friends she didn’t notice the mansion like building in the distance that they were approaching. </p><p>Sophie had just finished breakfast along with the other children, as she was going back to her room she was interrupted by three children, Eli, Josh and Ethan, or as Sophie called them “The blunderbrains”. As they blocked her path there was a slight pause until Sophie said with an annoyed tone “Ugh, what do you guys want?”, Ethan who had claimed himself as the leader of the group grinned slightly, “Oh, we’re just here to take you to your room, Isn’t that right?” the two boys behind him agreed, “I don’t need your help walking to my room, I can walk just fine thank you very much.” She said getting slightly more </p><p>annoyed, “Now move out of my way!” Ethan responded with “Who said we were going to walk you to your room?” Sophie looked confused now. “What?” was all she could say before the other two boys picked her up by her legs and arms. They ran down the hall and threw her into her room and blocked the door, she got up and started pound on it and threatened them if they didn’t let her out. The boys just snickered. This went on for a while until Sophie had an Idea, she moved her bed a little to reach the window, it wasn’t a long way down, but there was some roof she could stand on. She carefully and slowly made it down to the ground and ran back to the front door and opened the door, quietly and slowly stepped up the stairs back to where the boys where. they were trying to tease her but little did they know, she wasn’t in her room anymore. After a bit the boys got suspicious that she wasn’t responding and opened the door only to see that Sophie wasn’t there. They all went into the room and Sophie took this opportunity to run and shut the door on them. The three boys all ran and banged on the door demanding to be let out, Sophie let them know it was her by saying “Thanks for taking me to my room, blunderbrains!” and walked of softly laughing to herself. </p><p>At this same time, Emily was still in her car, she had fallen asleep. Her parents had also just pulled up to the Orphanage, they called to Emily, “Wake up dear! We’re here!” Emily opened her eyes slowly and turned towards the other window and gazed in amazement, “Is this a mansion?!” she said loudly with shock. Emily eagerly accompanied her parents as they walked up and knocked on the door. An old lady answered, “Oh, hello, can I help you kind folk?” said the old woman cheerfully, “Yes, we called in earlier” said Emily’s parents “For some business.” They added. “Oh then please come in! come in!” said the old lady with glee, she guided them to her office and handed them some papers to fill out as they sat down. After a few minutes of Emily’s parents filling out papers, Emily realized she still didn’t know what they are there for, this thought races through her mind over and over again, yet she still doesn’t want to ask. “What if it ruins the surprise?” Emily thought, “If there even is a surprise.” But before she could ask her parents one more time, they handed the papers back to the old lady and she left the room. </p><p>At the time Sophie was still laughing to herself about what she had just done until she was once again interrupted, but this time it was by the old lady, “Sophie, I need you to come with me.” As the old lady said this Sophie thought she was in trouble but had no choice but to go with the old lady. They walked down the stairs and down the hall to the old lady’s office. Sophie couldn’t help but feel like she was in trouble because of what she had just done until the guilt finally got to her and she blurted out “I’m sorry ma’am, I didn’t mean any harm to the boys!” the old lady looked at her confused, “What boys?” said the old lady curiously, Sophie then realized that she wasn’t in trouble, but explained what happened anyway. The old lady brushed it off as just children being children and opened her office door. </p><p>“Sophie, meet your new family.” </p><p> </p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Chapter 2ish </strong></p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p>Both Sophie and Emily were shocked, but Sophie was overjoyed as well to finally get a real family, even if it isn’t her own. Emily broke the silence “Why didn’t you tell me I was getting a sister!” She blurted to her parents. “Well, we did tell you that we we’re going to meet someone.” Emily’s parents said cheerfully “Yeah, but you didn’t say we we’re going to meet my new SISTER!” Emily said both overjoyed </p><p>and shocked. Sophie stood there very confused and was about to say something when Emily stood up, walked over to her and stuck her hand out “I’m Emily, what’s your name?” Emily said, already forgetting that Sophie’s name was announced when she came in. Sophie shook her hand “I’m Sophie, nice to meet you!” as she finished shaking her hand, the parents said their goodbyes to the old lady and told the children it was time to go. On the way to their car Emily and Sophie got to know each other better by telling each other what they liked “I like to listen to music, read and play with friends, what do you like to do?” Emily said to Sophie eagerly. Sophie thought about it for a moment “Hmm, I also like to read, the orphanage had this great big library full of a lot of good books! I haven’t listened to much music but I can play the piano, and I haven’t had many friends until now.” Said Sophie, “Well then, I’ll be your new friend Sophie, and I’ll teach you all I know about music!” Emily said with a friendly grin on her face. They got into the car, fastened their seatbelts and started conversing. Emily and Sophie talked so much for so long that Sophie hadn’t noticed they had just parked in the driveway of her new home. They were parked for a while when Sophie finally noticed where they were, she fell silent in the sheer joy of finally having an actual house to live in. They went into the house and showed Sophie her room, it was a newly cleaned out old room that was used as a spare guest room for a while. Sophie moved her things into her new room and unpacked them onto the floor because she didn’t have a bed at the moment. Emily then pulled Sophie away to show her room to Sophie and said she could stay in there until she got herself a bed, if she wanted. They spent a long while in the house, and during that while they got to the conversation of other siblings. “you know, it’s kind of ironic that you get the other room.” Said Emily, “Why’s that?” Sophie questioned, “It used to be my brother’s room, but now it’s my sister’s room” Emily said almost jokingly, “Can I ask what happened to your brother?” Sophie questioned once again, “He died, a while ago” Emily answered. Sophie felt bad, “Oh I’m sorry! I didn’t know-“ but before she could finish Emily interrupted “It’s okay, it’s not like he’ll mind” Emily said darkly. A really awkward silence fell for a few seconds, Sophie was thinking about what to say, “Do you….want to talk about it a little? Maybe that’ll help, it always helps when I talk about my problems…to myself of course since I didn’t have much friends.” Sophie asked, Emily seemed to think about it for a little until she finally said “Okay”. </p><p>Emily and Sophie talked about their past for a bit, the ups and downs, Emily found Sophie to be surprisingly comforting and easy to open up to, soon enough they were laughing and giggling about several topics, Emily had also told Sophie that next week they were going to visit her brother’s memorial bench, soon enough after that they decided it was time to go to bed, and to bed they went. </p><p>Minutes, hours, days and soon enough a week had passed. Sophie had gotten her room decorated and set up the day before, it was an early Sunday morning when Emily went to Sophie’s room and knock on her door, Sophie was awake but had not opened her eyes, after a few more knocks and Emily telling her to wake up, Sophie opened her eyes and looked out the window, it was snowing. She thought for a bit about why Emily was knocking and that’s when she realized, it was time to go see Emily’s brother’s memorial. Sophie quickly got out of bed and rushed to get dressed and ready for the day, she brushed her long blonde hair, and put on a nice cyan jacket. She opened her room door and rushed downstairs for breakfast, they were having some blueberry pancakes and fruit. They all said their good mornings, sat down and ate together with a nice conversation. After they all finished eating they got ready to head out the door to a nearby memorial park, as they got in the car Sophie asked if there was anything she needed to know or do, Emily shook her head and said “Just try to enjoy the peace” with a smile on her face as they entered the car and fastened their seatbelts. As they were driving Sophie couldn’t help but look at the beautiful scenery when it went by almost like a blur, she didn’t catch much of it but she knew </p><p>it was nice, she had always had a fascination with beautiful scenery and views. They had arrived at the memorial park and they all hopped out and walked to Emily’s brother’s memorial bench. “Here it is.” She said to Sophie, “Feel free to sit down, that’s what a bench is for isn’t it?” She added as she sat down, Sophie gave a smile and sat down next to Emily. Sophie started a conversation asking Emily how she felt about all of this and if she was okay. Emily explained that after all that Emily and her family went through, it felt like she had finished a chapter now, moving into the next year even though it’s been more a year. Emily takes a deep breath, as she sits next to her brother's memorial bench, and thinks about all the good times she's had with him. Sophie comforts Emily telling her that everything is going to be okay. Emily rests her head on Sophie’s shoulder and thanks her as she slowly drifts off into a nice peaceful slumber where she sees everything she misses about her great brother as the snowflakes lightly cover them. After a while Emily's parents finish their conversation and say, &quot;Come on girls, it's time to go home.&quot; Sophie wakes Emily up and lets her know that it’s time to leave. Their parents walk them back to the car with one last goodbye to Emily’s brother. </p><p> </p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>The End of chapter 1&amp;2…for now. </strong></p>                </div>            </div>        </div>    </div>    <div class="clear"></div></div></div><div class="widget widget-text-paragraph var-paragraph-standard" id="w-0568175561"><div class="pagegrid">    <div class="row">        <div class="six columns alpha omega">            <div class="content">                                <h2 class="theme-p-title theme-color3" data-target="title" data-clicktarget="#">                Fun World News                </h2>                                <div class="theme-p theme-color-4" data-target="content">                    <p><br/></p><p><strong>Mcdonald's Szechuan Sauce is back! You might find yourself asking “Why is it such a big deal?” or “Yeah, so what? A lot of places serve it”. Well, to answer your question, we have to go back 24 years. In 1998, the Disney movie Mulan was released, and the McDonald’s franchise decided to do a promotion of the movie by creating a sauce they described as “soy forward” and “highlighted by notes of ginger and garlic with a hint of sesame.” This was a big hit for teens and adults who got their food here, but eventually like all things in life, the Szechuan Sauce came to an end.</strong></p> <p><strong>Let’s jump to 2017: the hit Adult-Swim show Rick and Morty featured the sauce in one of its season three episodes. While scientist Rick Sanchez was being held captive by Galactic Federation, Rick visits a memory of the time he was able to access Szechuan Sauce. This caused some major chaos, and McDonald’s ended up sending Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland a whole bunch of emails and phone calls. This made all the fans remember how much they actually loved the sauce, so what did they do about it? They grouped up in angry crowds outside of local McDonald franchises and chanted the following: “We want sauce!” Eventually, things got out of control and the police got involved. Over 1000+ people actually came back and camped, demanding they get the sauce. Sadly, altogether, McDonalds only had 70 sauces. OK, so you might be thinking “Wow, all that for a sauce?” -- why yes. McDonalds posted “hi from Szechuan Sauce, say it back </strong><strong><u><a data-id="l-9384809745" href="https://t.co/JkEUM36Oi9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/JkEUM36Oi9</a></u></strong><strong> — McDonald's (@McDonalds)” on March 21st 2022.
